## Understanding the Pipeline View

The Pipeline View organizes candidates into different stages of your hiring process, providing a clear visual representation of each candidate's progress.

## Benefits

- Quickly assess the distribution of candidates across different stages
- Identify stages that need more attention or resources
- Ensure a smooth and efficient hiring process

## Layout

The Pipeline View is structured as follows:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Columns   | Each column represents a stage in your hiring process (e.g., "Applied," "Screening," "Interview") |
| Cards     | Candidates are shown as cards within these columns |
| Progress Indicators | Visual cues show how far along each candidate is in the process |

## Key Features

1. **Drag and Drop**: Move candidates between stages by dragging their cards.
2. **Quick Actions**: Access common actions like scheduling interviews or sending emails directly from a candidate's card.
3. **Stage Metrics**: View the number of candidates in each stage at a glance.

<Tip>
  Customize your pipeline stages to match your specific hiring process. This can be done in the ATS settings.
