## Types of Tests

Our ATS supports various types of assessments:

| Test Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Technical Skills | Evaluate coding abilities, problem-solving skills, etc. |
| Personality Assessments | Assess cultural fit and work style |
| Language Proficiency | Measure language skills for relevant positions |
| Cognitive Ability | Test problem-solving and critical thinking skills |

## Tracking Test Progress

After initiating a test:

1. The candidate's status in the pipeline will update to "Assessment In Progress"
2. You'll receive a notification when the candidate completes the test
3. Test results will be automatically added to the candidate's profile once available

<Warning>
  Ensure the candidate's email address is correct before initiating a test. Incorrect email addresses may result in candidates not receiving their assessments.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

After initiating tests, you may need to [edit candidate details](/candidate-pipeline-view/editing-details) to update their information based on test results or other new information.
