## Accessing the Candidate Profile

The Candidate Profile View provides detailed information about individual candidates. You can access this view directly from the Candidate Pipeline View, allowing for seamless navigation between your overall hiring pipeline and specific candidate details.

## Steps to Access

1. **Open Job Pipeline**: Navigate to the desired job pipeline in your ATS.

2. **Locate Candidate**: In the Candidate Pipeline View, find the name of the candidate you wish to review.

3. **Click Candidate Name**: Click on the candidate's name. This action will open the Candidate Profile View for that specific individual as a sidebar from the right side of the screen.

<Tip>
  Clicking on a candidate's name from any list view in the ATS will typically open their Candidate Profile View as a sidebar.
